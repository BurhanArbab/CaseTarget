<h1>Description</h1>
This is a case study report done on Target's data breach in 2013. <br/>
<br>
<b>Introduction</b>

This case presents the Target Corporation being subject to one of the largest cyberattacks in history. The objective is to determine what Target could have done differently to stop this breach from ever happening. While Target does have a cyber security team and a network that is being monitored, there were a lot of errors and complications that could have been easily avoided. Heading into Christmas of 2013, hackers stole credit and debit card information of more than 40 million customers. 

<b>Industry / Competitive Analysis</b>

Target’s origin could be traced back to Geroge Dayton’s establishment of a department store in 1902. In 1909, Dayton opened a discount store for customers who could not afford the higher priced department store. In 1962, the Dayton Company opened department stores branded Target at the same time Sam Walton was founding Walmart and Sebastian Kresge was starting Kmart. Target created its brand by selling quality goods at low prices, when its competitors focused on selling goods as cheaply as possible. 
For fiscal 2013, Target had revenues of over $72 billion, reflecting a 2.8% compound annual growth rate over the previous five years. As of November 2013, Target operated 1,919 stores, 1797 in the U.S. and 122 in Canada, representing over 254 million retail square feet. Target competed with the largest U.S. retailers, such as Walmart, Sears, and Kohl’s. Target stores have a wide range of options varying from electronics, household appliances, apparel, and even groceries. 
For how big of a company Target had become, their security team and operations were not up to standard with what it should be. On November 15, 2013, hackers used the credentials of targets external heating and ventilation providers, Fazio Mechanical Services, to gain access to Target’s network. Fazio had a free malware detection service that was prohibited for corporate use, but Fazio had used it anyway, and Target did not monitor the vendor’s security arrangements. To prevent an intrusion like this Target could have required two-factor authentication or any form of an enhanced password, but it wasn’t required. 

<b>Porter’s 5 Forces</b>

Rival Competitors: Target has multiple competitors such as Walmart, Amazon, and Costco, they all have the same type of products but differ in price, service, and convenience. Target’s brand image is selling quality goods at low prices in an upscale environment. When a breach like this occurs, it adds pressure to Target to maintain trust and brand reputation, especially if customers decide to switch to their rivals. 

Threat of Substitutes: Within retail there are many substitutes within person stores such as Walmart, Costco, Khol’s and online stores like Amazon that have virtually everything you need. Customers can go to another of these stores that they feel will protect them and is safer for them. The threat of substitutes is high. 

Threat of Buyers: Buyers have a lot of power when it comes to retail stores. They can choose where to shop, they can switch stores whenever, especially if they lose trust in the store. After the breach, many customers lost trust and reduced shopping at Target or switched stores entirely. Threat of buyers is very high.

Threat of Suppliers: Big retail companies like Target have many different manufacturers that supply clothing and electronics. This threat of suppliers is moderate to low. But for security and vendors that supply with more critical services will be a higher threat than the manufacturer.

Threat of New Entrants: In retailing there is low threat to new incoming companies that are trying to compete against Target or Walmart. New entrants that are entering cybersecurity have a much easier time since companies big or small need groups with technical expertise. 

<b>Business Issue</b>

In November of 2013, Target Corporation was the subject of one of the largest cyberattacks in history. Heading into Christmas, hackers stole credit and debit card information of 40 million Target customers and names, as well as home and email addresses for another 70 million. Hackers used Targets HVAC providers Fazio Mechanical Services to get into Target’s network and steal information. Target’s network was not properly segmented, and hackers found a route between a network from Fazio and the network for Target’s payment data. Target’s cybersecurity team in India alerted Target’s in-house security team in Minnesota indicating there was detected malware intrusions but never responded. Once the hackers started extracting data on December 2, the security team in India again alerted Target’s security team but got no response. According to two experts who audited the breach, “The breach could have been stopped there without human intervention. The system has an option to automatically delete malware as it’s detected… Target’s security team turned that function off.” 

<b>Key Stakeholders</b>

•	Gregg Steinhafel - Chairman, President, and CEO of Target

•	Target’s Security Team - The current IT team that deals with all of the systems

•	Fazio Mechanical Services - Target’s external heating and ventilation providers

•	Customers - The people who supported Target and were targeted 

•	Target’s Board of Directors - Made up of 10 members 

•	FireEye - Target’s malware detection tools and a team of security specialists in Bangalore, India


<b>Proposed Solutions and Alternate Courses of Action</b>

Courses of Action

1.	Improve Threat Detection and Incident Response 
The first option would be to improve Target’s threat detection and incident response. Target lacked in their security monitoring as well as their response time which resulted in the breach occurring. They can start by immediately responding to FireEye’s detections they found even if it’s a false positive. They need an established monitoring team that has the proper training that is always surveilling the network for any suspicious activity. The only downside is the cost, but that won’t be a problem for Target and it’s the least they could do.

Impact on Stakeholders

Target’s IT and security team would see an immediate impact on workload and accountability. Customers will have less exposure to data theft and feel more protected when shopping at target. Target’s executive board will gain more trust among shareholders and the public. FireEye will have a greater workload but will be greatly beneficial for Target. 

2.	Strengthen Data Protection and POS Security
The second option is for Target to implement advanced encryption and network defense for its POS systems. With access Fazio had, it was able to connect to Target’s payment system which should never be the case. Target needs to install software that will encrypt any personal information whether it’s a card being swiped or someone signed up for their REDcard. Considering how outdated their network security was I can only assume their POS software is also outdated, which they need to upgrade with software updates and patch any holes in their system that can lead into their network.

Impact on Stakeholders

Customers will have more financial data protection and can restore their trust in Target. Target’s IT won’t be affected too much by this once the software is installed. Target’s executives will have to make a short-term investment but will benefit them more in the long run. 

3.	Zero Trust Framework (Recommended Action)
My recommended course of action would be to install a zero-trust framework that will enforce strict access controls for monitoring for all third-party vendors that are connected to the network. Implementing least privilege for vendors means they should only have access to systems that were cleared to them by the security team. Target should also implement multi-factor authentication to prevent any attackers trying to use any stolen credentials.
 
Impact on Stakeholders

Target’s IT team would have a greater workload but would have better control and access over their networks. Vendors will have more security requirements, but it will also strengthen their own systems. Customers will have more confidence in Target’s data protection and will have reduced risk of identity theft.
